Overview
This HTML file is part of a project designed to create a web-based interface for searching and displaying podcasts. The HTML interfaces with a CSV file generated by a Python script, which pulls podcast data from various RSS feeds and compiles it into a structured format.

Key Components
Python Script: The provided Python script fetches podcast information from multiple RSS feeds using feedparser. It cleans and processes the data, including extracting keywords and summarizing content, and then writes this data to a CSV file.

HTML Interface: The HTML file uses JavaScript to fetch the CSV file and display its contents. Users can search through the podcast data and view detailed information, including links to the original podcast episodes.

Features
Dynamic Data Loading: The webpage dynamically loads podcast data from a CSV file.
Search Functionality: Users can search for podcasts using keywords.
Sortable and Interactive Table: Search results are displayed in an interactive table with sortable columns and collapsible content for detailed episode information.
Responsive Web Design: Styled with CSS for a user-friendly interface on various devices.
Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface.
Python with libraries such as feedparser, nltk, and BeautifulSoup for data fetching and processing.
CSV format for data storage and retrieval.
How to Use
Running the Python Script: Execute the Python script to fetch the latest podcast data from the RSS feeds and update the CSV file.
Accessing the HTML Interface: Open the HTML file in a web browser to interact with the updated podcast data.
Performing a Search: Input a search term to find relevant podcast episodes.
Viewing and Sorting Results: Browse through the table of results, sort columns, and expand details for more information.
Customization
Updating RSS Feeds: Add or remove RSS feed URLs in the Python script to customize the podcast sources.
Styling Adjustments: Modify the CSS in the HTML file to change the appearance of the interface.
Script Enhancements: Alter the Python script for different data processing or extraction methods.
Limitations
Relies on external RSS feeds for data; changes in feed structure may require script adjustments.
Internet access is necessary for fetching CSV data and accessing podcast links.
Browser Compatibility
Compatible with modern web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. JavaScript must be enabled for full functionality.
